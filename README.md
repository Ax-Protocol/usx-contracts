# USX

This repository contains all the code relevant to the USX smart contracts.

## What is USX?
- An ERC20 token enhanced with cross-chain capabilities.

## What makes USX unique?
- Native USX exists on all the chains supported by Ax Protocol, which means that USX can be sent to another chain without going back to a hub or core chain.
- The value of USX remains the same across all chains, making it fungible with itself on any Ax Protocol-supported chain.
- All USX cross-chain transfers result in native USX at the destination, not wrapped variants.
- USX cross-chain transfers require users to only pay for gas fees, making it cost-effective regardless of the transfer amount.
- There is zero slippage when transferring USX across chains, which means the amount sent always equals the amount received.
- By leveraging [Curve liquidity pools](https://curve.readthedocs.io/exchange-pools.html#plain-pools), USX achieves deeper liquidity and superior stability compared to USDC, USDT, or DAI individually.
