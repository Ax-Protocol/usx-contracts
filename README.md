# USX

USX will use an upgradable proxy (UUPS) or diamond pattern

USX will initially support LayerZero for bridging, but the interface architecture will support multiple 
bridging methods down the line

USX will initially support stablecoin deposit/redemption for mint/burn, but will later support multiple methods.

# TODOs

- consider the diamond pattern later for auditability if we must have upgrades
